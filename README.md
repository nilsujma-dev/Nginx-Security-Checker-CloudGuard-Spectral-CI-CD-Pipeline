## Check Point CloudGuard and Spectral Integrated CI/CD Pipeline for Nginx Docker Image

This GitHub repository hosts a Jenkins pipeline configuration designed to rigorously analyze the security of an Nginx Docker image. It mirrors the security-focused approach of the previous Node.js pipeline, utilizing Check Point CloudGuard and Spectral to scan for vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations in the latest Nginx image from DockerHub.

### Pipeline Overview
The pipeline automates the process of pulling the latest Nginx image, building a Docker container, and performing comprehensive security scans using both Spectral and ShiftLeft tools.

### Key Stages of the Pipeline
1. **Clone GitHub Repository**: Ensures the latest pipeline scripts and configurations are used.
2. **Spectral Installation**: Installs Spectral for scanning the codebase and Docker image.
3. **Pre-Build Spectral Scan**: Conducts initial security scans to detect any pre-existing issues in the Nginx image.
4. **Docker Image Build**: Builds the Nginx Docker image and prepares it for further scanning.
5. **ShiftLeft Security Scans**: Executes both online and offline scans on the Nginx Docker image, identifying any potential security vulnerabilities.
6. **Post-Build Spectral Scan**: Finalizes the security assessment with another round of Spectral scans after the build process.

### Objectives of the Pipeline
- **Comprehensive Security Analysis**: Identifies vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations in the Nginx Docker image, ensuring a secure deployment.
- **Latest Docker Image Assessment**: Focuses on the latest available Nginx image from DockerHub, guaranteeing up-to-date security insights.
- **Integration of Advanced Scanning Tools**: Uses Spectral for secret and misconfiguration detection and ShiftLeft for in-depth vulnerability scanning.

### Importance for CI/CD Security
- **Ensures Secure Deployments**: By rigorously scanning the Nginx image, the pipeline ensures that deployments are secure and compliant.
- **Automation of Security Practices**: Integrates advanced security checks seamlessly into the CI/CD workflow, promoting a culture of security within DevOps practices.
- **Proactive Vulnerability Management**: Enables early detection and remediation of security issues, reducing the risk of deploying compromised containers.

### Usage Scenario
This pipeline is essential for teams deploying Nginx in Docker environments, especially those prioritizing security in their CI/CD processes. It offers a detailed and automated approach to ensure that the Nginx deployments are secure, compliant, and free from known vulnerabilities.
